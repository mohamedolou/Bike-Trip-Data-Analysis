# Ford GoBike Exploration
## Mohamed OLOU


## Dataset

This dataset includes information about 183412 individuals trips made in a bike-sharing 
system covering the greater San Francisco Bay Area. We have some variable like start and 
end longitude and latitude, the riding duration, the start and end station id, the user 
birth date, the user gender and the user type (suscriber or customer).

## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, we found there is no strong relationship between the numerical value.
But by crossing categorial variables values with numerical values, we found many things.
We found that most of user are male and that most cyclist ride for 5 min to 8min and are 
between 26 and 36 years old. After that we observed that the peak of riding is between 
09:00am and 10:00am and between 05:00pm and 07:00pm. Then we remark after creating new 
column of distance that most of user ride on average for 1.25km. We also remark that most 
of user are male suscriber and that the customers dont share their bike in trip.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, we show the influence of gender and age on the distance 
the user is going to ride. 
We start by checking the distribution of some numerical and categorial variables
by using for numerical distplot and for categorical a countplot.
After that we check the correlation between numerical with a heatmap and check
relation with gender, duration, age and distance with diferent type of chart.
